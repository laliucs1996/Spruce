# Spruce
Spruce is a movie and television review/rating website modeled after Rotten Tomatoes. <br/>
Website was designed by using bootstrap and incorporates basic colors for ease on the eyes. <br/>
The website is supported by a MySQL Database and a Python Script for data grabbing from themoviedb.org's API. Additional python frameworks from Python, such as the Pandas Framework, was used to structure the database for easy injection of data.
<br/> Backend was supported with Java and JQuery to allow for easy data transfer from the database to the DOM. <br/>
Accessing the information given by the backend was done using Ajax, for versatility, and JSTL.
# Features
The website itself supported multiple features popular in normal movie reviewing sites.
It showed a multitude of Movie and Television titles with their details such as detailed descriptions, actors, categories, duration and other specifics.
The homepage featured Recent/Top/Popular Movies and TV Shows all determined by the people reviewing in site and the number of people watching.
Any user can rate and review any Movie and TV Show, but select users would be categorized as critics which allowed them to have their own category of reviewing and rating.
